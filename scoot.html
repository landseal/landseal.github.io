		<h2> Tall Kick Scooter </h2>

		<body>
			<p>
				Way back freshman year, before I learned how to longboard, somewhat inspired by Charles Guan and his wonderful <a href="http://www.etotheipiplusone.net/">blog</a>, I decided that a kick scooter would be the best way to get around. The problem was (and is), I don't really fit any kick scooters. 
			</p>
			<p>	They're all too short.</p>
			<p> So I did what any real engineer would do... I designed and built my own.</p>
			<p> 
				However, I hadn't ever really designed/built anything big like this before, so it has some pretty interesting design choices. For example, I was scared of pulling the handlebars right off the steerer so I decided the best way to hold it would be to drill a hole in the steerer shaft and put a bolt through it. However, this weakened the shaft considerably and resulted in the shaft breaking in half about a week after I started riding the scooter around.
			</p>
			<p>
				I fixed it by making the handlebar riser clamp to the shaft, so I didn't have to drill through it. I also bought a stronger hardened steel shaft. Below are some pictures of its current state. I still ride it around occasionally. Mostly when it rains and I don't want to get my nice longboard bearings wet.
