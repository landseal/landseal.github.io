				Hoverboard Motor Characterization

				<p>
					Edit: I just read/realized that Km is not proportional to a motor's ability to make torque. It's actually Km<sup>2</sup> that is proportional to a motor's ability to make torque. I'll have to revise some stuff to do Km<sup>2</sup>/$ and stuff like that.
				</p>
				<p>
					I bought a replacement motor for a hoverboard on ebay for about $35 shipped. I did a quick analysis of some of its specs to determine its potential for higher power output. I also needed a really cheap and fairly tame sensored motor as a test mule for the brushless motor controller I want to build.
				</p>
				<p> Specs: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Mass: 3185.6g</li>
					<li>27N30P configuration</li>
					<li>Phase resistance: 0.3 &#937</li>
					<li>Kv: 18 rpm/V</li>
					<li>Kt: 0.53 Nm/A</li>
					<li>Km: 0.97 Nm/A/sqrt(R)</li>
					<li>Stator dimensions: 105mm OD, 29mm length</li>
					<li>No load loss: 31.5V*0.68A = 21.4W at 559rpm</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					I only got one no load point because the Castle Creations HV80 controller I was using didn't record any current for the 22.2V test. Thus, I'll have to model the parasitic losses linearly for now i.e. I can't account for eddy current losses rising with the square of rpm.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Km/$ ratio is extremely high at 0.97/35=0.0277. For comparison, the popular "big block" inrunner is 6.4x lower at 0.75/175=0.0043. Granted, Km only represents a motor's ability to produce torque, so the "big block" makes up for some of its torque shortcomings with speed as it can probably spin 2-3x faster than the hoverboard motor.
				</p>
				<p>
					The specific Km is 0.97/3.2=0.30 Km/kg. A "big block" motor is half as good at 0.75/5.3=0.14 Km/kg. The very high performance and expensive Joby JM1S is 50% better at 0.832/1.8=0.46. The hoverboard motor matches up very well with these other motors.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are a couple drawbacks to the motor out of the box that reduce its value. First, its power potential cannot be achieved without either a rewind for a higher Kv or using a DC bus >150V.  Second, attaching a sprocket to it will be somewhat difficult as its original purpose was to be a hub motor.
