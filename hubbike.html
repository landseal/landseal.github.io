			<h2> Hubmotor Electric Bike</h2>

			<body>
				<p>
					After all the pain of putting together my rcbike just to discover that it was too loud for my tastes, I wanted an electric bike that would just work. I converted my brother's mountain bike to run off an electric hubmotor using a 48V 1000W kit. The kit assembled in under two hours. I did spend a couple more hours making a torque arm to help relieve the aluminum dropouts from taking the full the motor torque, but it was amazing how easy it was. I reused the batteries from my rcbike.

					Hubmotors are definitely a lot quieter and easier to install than motors that are 16x lighter and spin 16x faster and thus need several stages of gearing reduction just to be able to drive a bike wheel instead of the propeller they were designed for.
