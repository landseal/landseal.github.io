			<h2> RC Electric Bike</h2>

			<body>
				<p>
					I converted my mountain bike to run off an electric outrunner motor designed for large model airplanes using a kit from a guy (username: thud) on the endless-sphere forum.
				</p>
				<p>Specs</p>
				<ul> 
					<li>Motor: Aeolian 6374 170Kv motor</li>
					<li>Batteries: 6x 4S 5000mAh hardcase packs for 12S, 10Ah total</li>
					<li>Controller: Castle Creations HV80</li>
					<li>Gearing: 1st stage - 14:40 #25 chain, 2nd stage - 12:84 #35 chain</li>
					<li>Top speed: around 25 mph</li>
				</ul>

					At first, I tried to go friction drive with the can of the outrunner spinning directly on the tire. However, it turns out that pumping 30V*80A=2400W into a knobby mountain bike tire from a smooth steel motor can ends up with a lot of melted tire and not very much go. I ended up writing my college application personal statement about the experience.
				</p>
				<p> 
					From there I decided to go chain drive. A guy on endless-sphere gave me a kit that kinda worked, but I thought the primary chain reduction was too loud at 7500 rpm so I took it off and just pedaled my bike. I think I would have been fine with the noise if my bike was actually fast, but it was only geared for ~25mph and I was kinda embarassed by it.

					Some day I'm going to build an actual high performance ebike. Something like 90lbs, 70mph top speed, 20kW peak. Right after I build that custom axial flux motor I designed in like 11th grade and that kA BLDC controller that enables motorcycle performance at nonlethal voltages. I always said I'd do it in college, but 7 semesters have come and gone and no bikes/motors/controllers have appeared... There's always hope though.
